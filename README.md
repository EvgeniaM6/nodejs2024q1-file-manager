This task is File Manager using Node.js APIs.

```bash
npm run start -- --username=your_username
```

- After starting the program displays `Welcome to the File Manager, Username!`

- Finish program work, display the following text in the console  
`Thank you for using File Manager, Username, goodbye!`  
```bash
.exit
```

- In case of unknown operation or invalid input (missing mandatory arguments, wrong data in arguments, etc.) `Invalid input` message is shown and user is able to enter another command
- In case of error during execution of operation `Operation failed` message is shown and user is able to enter another command (e.g. attempt to perform an operation on a non-existent file or work on a non-existent path should result in the operation fail)

- If the path contains **whitespaces** in the folder or file name, use starlike symbol (*)

## List of operations and their syntax:
- Navigation & working directory (nwd)
    - Go upper from current directory (when you are in the root folder this operation doesn't change working directory)  
    ```bash
    up
    ```
    - Go to dedicated folder from current directory (`path_to_directory` can be relative or absolute)
    ```bash
    cd path_to_directory
    ```
    - Print in console list of all files and folders in current directory
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
- Basic operations with files
    - Read file and print it's content in console: 
    ```bash
    cat path_to_file
    ```
    - Create empty file in current working directory: 
    ```bash
    add new_file_name
    ```
    - Rename file (content remains unchanged): 
    ```bash
    rn path_to_file new_filename
    ```
    - Copy file: 
    ```bash
    cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory
    ```
    - Move file: 
    ```bash
    mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory
    ```
    - Delete file: 
    ```bash
    rm path_to_file
    ```
- Operating system info (prints following information in console)
    - Get EOL (default system End-Of-Line) and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --EOL
    ```
    - Get host machine CPUs info and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --cpus
    ```
    - Get home directory and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --homedir
    ```
    - Get current *system user name* and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --username
    ```
    - Get CPU architecture for which Node.js binary has compiled and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --architecture
    ```
- Hash calculation  
    - Calculate hash for file and print it into console  
    ```bash
    hash path_to_file
    ```
- Compress and decompress operations  
    - Compress file  
    ```bash
    compress path_to_file path_to_destination
    ```
    - Decompress file  
    ```bash
    decompress path_to_file path_to_destination
    ```
